Injestor
========
The injestor is a daemon which runs a series of services for ingesting the edX data package.
Each service scans a data directory for specific data and ingests it into either a MySQL or MongoDB
database.  These scans are run and repeated every 5 minutes.  The daemon also provides a REST API to
read the current state of the ingestion.  

The ingested databases are designed to work in conjunction with the UQx-API application: https://github.com/UQ-UQx/uqx_api


Requirements
---------------------
To use the iptocountry service you will need to install the GeoIP2Country.mmdb (available from https://www.maxmind.com/en/country)
```bash
cp GeoIP2-Country.mmdb [BASE_PATH]/services/iptocountry/lib/
```

Installation
---------------------
[BASE_PATH] is the path where you want the injestor installed (such as /var/injestor)

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UQ-UQx/injestor.git [BASE_PATH]
```
Set injestor configuration
```bash
cp [BASE_PATH]/config.example.py [BASE_PATH]/config.py
vim [BASE_PATH]/config.py
[[EDIT THE VALUES]]
```
Install init.d script (optional, only tested on Centos6.5)
```bash
ln [BASE_PATH]/init.d/injestor /etc/init.d/injestor
```
Run injestor
```bash
/etc/init.d/injestor start
(or) [BASE_PATH]/injestor.py start
```
If you need to test a particular service, you can run
```bash
[BASE_PATH]/test.py [[SERVICENAME]]
```
If you wish to deploy the ingestor to a server, you can use the supplied fab (http://www.fabfile.org/) script (once the config is set)
```
fab prepare deploy
```

Architecture
---------------------
The architecture for the injestor is not meant to be standalone, but work with an unencrypted version of the Research Data Package.
For more information on getting the data package please see: https://edx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=36044863 .

The flow of the data is as follows:
